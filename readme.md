## About our Mansory Blog

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
Mansory is a web application, main idea of this web app is to be an interactive blog where users that are keen on Software and Tech can post useful stories and posts about various software, hardware and tools. 

It is also important that nowdays we educate people and children about these topics, this blog app can be useful for elder and younger people, it can educate them in techincal way or it can help them improve their theoretical or practical knowledge.

## Using the application

Main focus of this web application is that users are free to do most of the things, you can upload pictures, posts, texts, but you can also delete and edit them, you have your own dashboard that only you can see, but you also can access blog page where you can see all the blogs.
In the service page you can see all the topics people should focus on and talk about, but there can be much more than that.

## Hint for the teacher how to test the app

If you run the web app on your machine there may not be any dummy data, but I advise you to register 2 profiles and make more than 5 posts, for example 3 posts for each profile, so you can test it properly and see how authorization, access control and other features work.
