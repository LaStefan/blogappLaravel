## About our Mansory Blog

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
Mansory is a web application, main idea of this web app is to be an interactive blog where users that are keen on Software and Tech can post useful stories and posts about various software, hardware and tools. 

It is also important that nowdays we educate people and children about these topics, this blog app can be useful for elder and younger people, it can educate them in techincal way or it can help them improve their theoretical or practical knowledge.

## Using the application

Main focus of this web application is that users are free to do most of the things, you can upload pictures, posts, texts, but you can also delete and edit them, you have your own dashboard that only you can see, but you also can access blog page where you can see all the blogs.
In the service page you can see all the topics people should focus on and talk about, but there can be much more than that.

# Please read this carefully before testing 
## Important hint 

If you run the web app on your machine there may not be any dummy data, so you will need to do db:seed command, once you do that, you will get one user and six posts. 
Password for that user is: 12345678

But my advice is to, after seeding, register your own account and then see the difference and test the web app in a proper way check if the dates are correct, name of the user who made the blog, etc. One problem occurs when you seed the dummy data the pictures on the blog page they don't appear, but when you make the post and upload pictures from your pc they show up nicely, please check it out.
